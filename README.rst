Official Django client for Replyify
===================================

A Django wrapper for Replyify's Python API bindings.

Installation
------------

You can install this package by using the pip tool and installing:
::

    $ pip install django-replyify-oauth2

Or:
::

    $ easy_install django-replyify-oauth2

Register Your Application with Replyify
---------------------------------------

-  Sign up for Replyify at https://app.replyify.com/access/signup

-  Register your application at
   https://app.replyify.com/oauth2/applications/register

   -  Supported OAuth2 configuration is Public / Authorization code.

Configure the django-replyify-oauth2 module
-------------------------------------------

From your previously configured app, found at https://app.replyify.com/oauth2/applications add the following to your Django `settings.py`:
::

    REPLYIFY_CLIENT_ID = '{ update me }'
    REPLYIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = '{ update me }'
    REPLYIFY_REDIRECT_URI = '{ update me, must match value set from previous step'
    REPLYIFY_USER_ID_FIELD = 'id'  # or other primary key user field like `guid`
    REPLYIFY_DENIED_REDIRECT = '/path/when/user/denies/access'  # defaults to home page

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'replyify_oauth2',
        ...
    ]

And add the following to your `urls.py`
::

    from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url
    urlpatterns = patterns(
        ...
        url(r'^replyify/', include('replyify_oauth2.urls', namespace='replyify')),
        ...
    )

Run migrate
::

    **$ python manage.py migrate**

In templates
::

    <a href="{% url 'replyify:authorize' %}?next={% url 'home'|urlencode %}">Connect to Replyify</a>

Note: you can pass `next` query parameter to the authorize view to direct the user to correct page after OAuth flow has completed successfully.  Default will send user to '/'

In views as a decorator: this will kick off the Authorization flow or Refresh request (if token is expired) and will send the user back to the original requested url on completion
::

    from replyify_oauth2.decorators import replyify_auth_required

    @replyify_auth_required
    def my_view_that_needs_replyify(request):
        ...
